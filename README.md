# Open Source Project List

List of open source projects that are great for regular developers to gain real experience in various tech stacks. 

Inspired by [NBN Atlas project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub)  that I maintain (listed below). See also [opensource-for-good-causes](https://github.com/h-m-jones/opensource-for-good-causes)

If you are a maintainer of an open-source project or can recommend an open-source project to developers, let us know about it [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## React 

- [NBN Atlas project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub) <br>  Get stuck in developing React components for the NBN Atlas of UK biodiversity data. We need simple, visually cool components that nature based charities and voluntary organisations can use in their websites. Help us make a difference. (Also looking to start an Expo component package and interested in ideas for Python (big data?) projects.)
