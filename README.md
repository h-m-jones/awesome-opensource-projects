# awesome-opensource-projects

Awesome open source projects for developers to gain real experience in various tech stacks. It's a great way to keep your skills up to date.

Inspired by [NBN Atlas project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub)  that I maintain (listed below). See also [opensource-for-good-causes](https://github.com/h-m-jones/opensource-for-good-causes)

If you are a maintainer of an open-source project or  can recommend an open-source project, add it to the list:  fork this repo, add the details to the README.md and issue a PR. State what the main language/framework is.

## React 

- [NBN Atlas project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub) <br>  Get stuck in developing React components for the NBN Atlas of UK biodiversity data. We need simple, visually cool components that nature based charities and voluntary organisations can use in their websites. Help us make a difference. (Also looking to start an Expo component package and interested in ideas for Python (big data?) projects.)
